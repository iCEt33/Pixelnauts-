Terms of Service (ToS) for Beebo
Effective Date: 10/23/2024
Last Updated: 09/29/2025

By using this bot, you agree to the following Terms of Service (ToS). Please read these terms carefully, as they govern your use of the bot and explain how your data is handled.

1. Purpose of the Bot
The purpose of Beebo is to provide entertainment, moderate server chats, and enhance engagement within your community. 
The bot offers chat moderation, chatbot capabilities, and various other functionalities for the purpose of increasing engagement.

2. Data Collection
The bot requires the following information in order to function:

User Data: Usernames and User IDs.
Server Data: Server IDs, Channel IDs, and messages sent in the server (or direct messages to the bot).
Core Memory Data: The bot creates persistent user profiles from conversation history to provide personalized experiences. Users can view, disable, or delete this data at any time using bot commands.

3. Data Storage and Use
Collected data is temporarily stored within the app's runtime environment, which operates on a local device (phone). This means data is not permanently stored or shared with third parties unless required for bot functionality.
Third-Party Integration: The bot uses OpenAI for chatbot features and spam detection. OpenAI processes user messages for these purposes.
Data retention: Data is not stored permanently beyond the immediate use within the bot's script. Once the bot processes data (e.g., for a response or moderation), the data is discarded.

4. Web3 Features and Cryptocurrency
- Users acknowledge that cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible
- The bot requires a small verification transaction (0.0001 POL) to link wallets
- Users are responsible for ensuring they enter correct wallet addresses
- Gas fees are automatically calculated and deducted from transactions
- The bot is not responsible for:
  * Lost funds due to incorrect wallet addresses
  * Network fees or failed transactions
  * Market volatility or cryptocurrency value changes
  * Delays in transaction processing

Security Best Practices
- Never share your private keys
- Always verify wallet addresses before sending
- Keep your verification transaction receipt
- Report any suspicious activity immediately

Currently, the bot only supports transactions on the Polygon network. Attempting to send or receive funds from other networks may result in permanent loss of funds.

5. Age Restrictions
Users must meet the minimum age requirement as stipulated by Discord’s Terms of Service (13 years of age or older, or as required by local law).
If users are minors, they must have parental or guardian consent. The responsibility for ensuring this consent lies with the parent or guardian.

6. User Conduct & Rules
By using Beebo, users agree to:

Abide by the server’s own chat etiquette and rules, typically outlined in the server’s rules channel.
Avoid spamming or excessively interacting with the bot, as it may cause the bot to be rate-limited, leading to delays or unresponsiveness.
Users are prohibited from exploiting or misusing the bot for purposes, malicious, or otherwise.

7. Consequences for Rule Violations
If any user violates these terms:

The bot owner reserves the right to review chat logs for unusual behavior or violations.
The bot may be removed from a server without prior notice if necessary.
Repeat offenders may be banned from using the bot or its features.

8. Reporting Issues and Support

9. Updates to the ToS
We reserve the right to update this ToS as needed. Any changes will be posted publicly. Users are encouraged to review the ToS periodically to stay informed of any updates.
In the future, we may introduce a newsletter or notification system to provide updates on the bot, game projects, and changes to this ToS.

10. Monetization and Subscription Services
Payments and subscriptions are handled directly through Discord.
Refunds: All payment and refund inquiries should be directed to Discord, as the platform handles these transactions.
Subscription Management: Users can manage their subscriptions directly via Discord's platform (e.g., canceling, upgrading, or downgrading subscriptions).

11. Third-Party Integrations
Certain features of the bot (such as chatbot and moderation functions) rely on external services, particularly OpenAI. By using these features, you acknowledge that third-party services have their own Terms of Service and Privacy Policies. Please refer to these third-party terms when applicable.

12. Limitation of Liability
  a. General Disclaimer
  The bot is provided "as-is" and "as-available" without warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied. We do not guarantee that the bot will be free from defects, uninterrupted, or that it will meet your expectations. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, expressed or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
  
  b. Limitation of Liability
  In no event shall we, or any of our developers, be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, interruptions, or any damages arising from the use or inability to use the bot, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. We will only be liable to refund any amount you have actually paid to access the bot's premium services or features. We do not provide compensation for non-material claims such as data loss, emotional distress, or inconvenience.
  
  c. Exceptions in Compliance with Applicable Law
  This limitation of liability applies to the fullest extent permitted by law in the relevant jurisdiction. However, certain jurisdictions, such as within the United States and the European Union, may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability for certain types of damages. In such jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law, and this provision will be interpreted to provide the maximum limitation on liability allowed.
  
  d. Specific to U.S. Users
  For U.S. users, we acknowledge that certain state laws may limit the enforceability of blanket liability waivers. In cases where such limitations apply, we shall not be liable for any damages exceeding the amount you paid, if any, to access the bot's premium features or services. We do not provide compensation beyond the amount you paid to use the bot's premium features.
  
  e. Specific to EU Users
  For users within the European Union, our liability will be limited in accordance with applicable consumer protection laws. We will not exclude or limit our liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud, or fraudulent misrepresentation.

  f. User-Generated Content & AI Responses

  We are not liable for any actions taken as a result of interactions with the bot, including but not limited to advice or suggestions related to personal injury, death, or any harmful behavior. The bot uses AI-generated responses, including services provided by third parties like OpenAI, and these responses are generated based on user input. We make no warranties about the appropriateness, accuracy, or safety of such responses.
  
  The bot is not intended to provide professional advice, guidance, or instructions, particularly related to health, safety, or legal matters. If you encounter an inappropriate response or harmful content, please contact us immediately at pixelcryptonauts@gmail.com. We take this seriously and will take corrective action, but we disclaim any liability for misuse or harmful outcomes resulting from bot interactions.
  
  Furthermore, we reserve the right to immediately disable or limit the bot's functionality if it is being used to encourage or facilitate illegal or harmful activities.

  - Lost or stolen cryptocurrency
  - Transactions sent to incorrect addresses
  - Network fees or gas costs
  - Delays in transaction processing
  - Any losses due to network issues or blockchain congestion
  - Losses due to user error in wallet verification or sending process

13. Termination of Service
We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the bot at any time, for any reason, including rule violations or the protection of the bot’s functionality.

14. User-Generated Content
If the bot interacts with user-generated content (e.g., chat logs or messages), users are responsible for ensuring their content complies with all applicable laws and does not infringe on the rights of third parties. Inappropriate or illegal content will be removed.

15. Data and Privacy Protection
The bot collects the following data:

Server Data: Server IDs and Channel IDs to facilitate interaction within the server.
User Data: Usernames and messages sent via direct messages or in channels where the bot is active.
We do not share any of this data with third parties, except for the chatbot feature, which uses OpenAI to process certain commands and messages.

Security: While we strive to ensure the data processed by the bot is secure, please understand that the bot is run locally and data is temporarily stored only for operational purposes.

16. Governing Law
These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Hungary, without regard to its conflict of law principles. However, if you reside outside of Hungary, you may be entitled to protections and rights under the consumer protection laws of your own country. By using this bot, you agree that any legal action arising out of or related to the use of this bot will first attempt to be resolved in accordance with Hungarian law and courts.
