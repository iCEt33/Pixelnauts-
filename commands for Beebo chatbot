documentation for B-b0

first things first:
-------------------
ON/OFF switch

"shut down"
"wakey wakey" 

only moderators, so roles with admin rights! can trigger this and basically most of the features
-------------------

the bot has limited DM capabilities = 9 messages

now the next thing
-------------------
Naught Gamer role

created when the bot joins a server
-------------------

the bot also has a spam filter, this comes in handy for web3 servers!
if your server gets spammed with like a fake announcement and/or giveaway scam and the bot doesn't delete it,
please forward that message to me and I'll update the filter! 
For good measure I've also added a GPT based filter too, just in case

please note that people tried exploiting the bot by making it say stuff backwards or
making it say stuff 800 times for no reason... I added countermeasures for that too, to go easy on the API
-------------------
Reminders!

"remind me"
"remind us"

example message: remind me 5m gaming
result: you'll get a DM 5 minutes later saying: gaming
same with remind us only difference is that 'me' sends the user a DM and 'us' sends it in the same text channels
------------------

"flip a coin"

flips a coin
------------------

the bot also has random GIF reactions so when people type stuff like W, L, sheesh, the bot might send a GIF

------------------
Magic 8 ball

there's a few ways to trigger this but the simplest is the format 'magic8 [your question]'
------------------

now if someone has the Naughty Gamer role, you can type "free @user" to free them or type "free all"
you can send someone to prison by typing "sentence @user to prison for xy months/years"
I think months is minutes and years is hours

------------------
Rock Paper Scissors

"rps" or "rock paper scissors" will start a game
------------------
To chat with Beebo simply include "Beebo, B-b0, B" in the sentence, it has to be capital B in all cases!

it has a few personalities namely:

Jamaican
"bomboclat"
"huihui"

Casual
"casual"
"yapping"

Saul Goodman
"better call saul"
"saul goodman"

Bob
"Bob"
"bobby"

Terminator
"terminator"
"terminated"
-------------------
CAP mode

"capping"
"nocap"

this will react to a user's message that has the word "cap" in it 
-------------------
Blackjack

"rigged"
"legit"

after that if someone types "blackjack" it will start a game of blackjack

type hit/stay to play
------------------

"wish me luck" - the bot will wish you luck

------------------
I also added a gaming queue in case 10 people want to play in a 5 person squad

"who is ready for gaming" - will start the stuff, after that whoever types "me" will be added to a list

"show gaming list" - will show current gamers who typed "me"
"the gaming squad" - will generate a squad randomly

------------------
Latin characters mode

"ascii"
"noscii"

it will delete messages with non-latin characters like when people type in russian 
------------------
Experimental memory

"!showcontext"
"!deletecontext"

when the bot is triggered it will try to store and use some previous messages from the user
------------------
Chatbot

just tag the bot or include "B, Beebo, B-b0" in your message and it should respond
------------------
------------------

That's about it I think. Have fun!
